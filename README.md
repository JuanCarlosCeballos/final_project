# Austin Crime Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the last 20 years of real crimes committed in the City of Austin, Texas. The purpose of this project is to explore real data and gain insights using Tableau.

## Data Source
The raw data was downloaded from the [Austin government website](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-reports-bf2b7). The dataset contains more than 2 million rows of crime data.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Downloaded raw crime data from the Austin government website.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Used Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda environment to clean the data.
- Performed data cleaning operations using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution, trends, and patterns.
- Utilized various Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

### 4. Data Filtering
- Filtered the data to focus on the last 5 years (2019 to 2023).
- Selected the 15 most recurrent crimes for detailed analysis.

### 5. Mapping
- Used the Folium library to create interactive maps in Jupyter Notebook to visualize the geographical distribution of crimes.

### 6. Data Visualization
- Created interactive dashboards using Tableau Desktop to visualize the crime data and derive insights.
- Due to the heaviness of the data, shared an extract of the data on Tableau Public for easy access.

## Results
The analysis helped in understanding the crime trends in Austin over the past 5 years, focusing on the most recurrent crimes. The Tableau dashboards provide an interactive way to explore the data and gain meaningful insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning, EDA, and mapping
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for data analysis
